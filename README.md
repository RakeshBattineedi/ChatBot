# ChatBot

Programming languages: Java and socket programming

I am creating a chatbot server. This chatbot accepts strings containing English sentences, and responds with strings that sound as human as possible. He has not yet completed his chatbot code, but he knows he will want to create a chatbot server so various clients can connect and interact with the chatbot.
